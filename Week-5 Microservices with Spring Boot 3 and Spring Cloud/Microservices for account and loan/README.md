# 🏦 Microservices Assignment: Account & Loan Services

This project demonstrates a hands-on implementation of two independent Spring Boot microservices: **Account Service** and **Loan Service**. Each service is a standalone Maven-based RESTful application built using Spring Boot.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
Microservices for account and loan/
├── account/ # Account microservice
│ └── src/
│ └── pom.xml
├── loan/ # Loan microservice
│ └── src/
│ └── pom.xml
├── README.md
```

## 📌 Notes
No backend or database is connected — responses are hardcoded or random/dummy as per assignment instructions.

Each microservice runs independently on its own port (That's the base idea behind Microservice) .

Designed for educational purposes to demonstrate microservices architecture.

## ✅ Output
✔️ Both microservices tested and working independently via browser.
